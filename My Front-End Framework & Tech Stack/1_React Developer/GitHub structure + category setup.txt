Here’s a professional React GitHub structure + category setup that makes your profile clean, impressive, and easy to navigate—for both recruiters and clients.

✅ 1. Repo Naming Conventions
Use clear, keyword-rich names:

Type	Example
Portfolio	portfolio-react, my-portfolio-nextjs
Clone Projects	twitter-clone-react, airbnb-clone-nextjs
Real Projects	client-dashboard, ecommerce-shop-react
Practice / Sandbox	react-hooks-practice, nextjs-auth-tests
UI Kits	react-ui-kit, tailwind-components
Boilerplate	react-boilerplate-ts, nextjs-starter

🗂️ 2. GitHub Folder/Repo Structure (inside a typical React project)
bash
Copy code
project-root/
├── public/
│   └── assets/         # images, icons, etc.
├── src/
│   ├── assets/         # static files (SVG, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── components/     # reusable components (e.g. Button, Modal)
│   ├── features/       # feature-based folders (if using Redux or modules)
│   ├── pages/          # for Next.js or React Router setup
│   ├── routes/         # all route configs if using React Router
│   ├── hooks/          # custom hooks (useAuth, useDebounce)
│   ├── utils/          # helper functions, formatters
│   ├── services/       # API services (e.g. axios instances)
│   ├── store/          # Redux / Zustand / Context files
│   ├── layouts/        # reusable layouts (SidebarLayout, AuthLayout)
│   └── App.jsx / App.tsx
├── .env               # for API keys
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
└── README.md
🏷️ 3. GitHub Category Setup (Repo-Level Tags & Folders)
You can organize or tag your repositories like this:

Category	What to include
Portfolio	Your personal site, resume, intro
Clone Projects	UI/UX-focused clones (e.g. Netflix clone)
UI Kits	Component libraries or Tailwind sets
Full Stack	React + backend (Node.js, Firebase, etc.)
React + API	Projects with REST API / GraphQL
Practice / Demos	Hook practice, animations, testing
Boilerplate / Starters	Reusable templates
Next.js / SSR	Projects with server-side rendering
Mobile / React Native	If you use React Native

## 🧩 Optional: GitHub Projects / Profile Readme

You can also:
- Add a **pinned projects section**
- Create a **GitHub profile README** (via special repo `username/username`)
- Create **GitHub Projects** board to show tasks / roadmap

Want a **Notion template** to track all your projects with tags like:
